# PromptOps

My ultimate AI prompts collection that I used daily as a DevOps.

All based on the **C.R.A.F.T.** framework.

## C.R.A.F.T. framework

**C.R.A.F.T.** is a straightforward framework for constructing effective prompts
for technical, and especially DevOps-related, tasks. It’s a checklist to ensure
you’re giving the AI everything it needs to deliver a high-quality result on the
first try.

• **C**ontext: Provide the background and current situation.

• **R**ole: Assign a job title or persona to the AI.

• **A**ction: What is the specific thing you want the AI to do?

• **F**ormat: What should the final output look like?

• **T**one: What style should the AI use in its response?
